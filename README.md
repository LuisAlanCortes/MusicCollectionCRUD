# C++ CRUD Application - Using Manual Array Sizing
## Music Collection Create, Read, Update, Delete project that reads in a .txt file of known format and ports data into a struct.
The struct is a resizeable array using pointers.
Data is validated for correctness, and the user is prompted to fix any data after data file is read.

## Code Breakdown:
- Struct employee registry - Holds First/Last names, employee ID, and phone number
    - Open file, read lines to size struct array
    - Calc capacity of array to 1.5 factor size
    - Create dynamically allocated struct array with capacity
    - Process data into struct array, delimit by spaces
    - Validate phone number and IDs for duplicates, length, correctness, and structure
        - Loop through struct array checking each element for each criteria
    - Sentienl controlled menu
        - List all employee details
            - Loop through struct array and display all elements in a table using setw
        - List employee by last name
            - Linear Search through array with given last name from user and return the employee if found, if not error
                - Can have duplicates so continue to search if found
        - Add a new employee
            - Resize struct array if needed, add employee element at size
        - Remove an employee
            - Search for employee by last name or ID, pushback array to overwrite for employee, error if not found
                - If last name, ask for confirmation on deletion
        - Show all managers only
            - Search by the first element of the employee ID(8), display each element with match
        - Show all staff only
            - Search by the first element of the employee ID(1), display each element with match
        - Quit
            - Flip sentinel
    - Close file
    - Delete dynamic array

CPP1 Final project.
